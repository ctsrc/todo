# TODO PWA

An offline-capable [Progressive Web Application](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Guides/What_is_a_progressive_web_app) (PWA)
that ChatGPT made for me. Some small tweaks and additions were later added by me.

As the name implies, it's a TODO list web app.

Of course a million TODO web apps exist already. It is widely known that TODO apps are more or less the "hello world" of web apps.

The reason I wanted to have a TODO app, is that I wanted one that is super basic and that doesn't require any build step and that can work as an offline-capable PWA. So this is that, and here it is. Thanks, ChatGPT! :)
