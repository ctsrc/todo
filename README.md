# TODO PWA

An offline-capable PWA that ChatGPT made for me. Some small tweaks and additions were later added by me.

As the name implies, it's a TODO list web app. Of course a million of those exist already, but I wanted a super basic one that doesn't require any build step and that can work as an offline-capable PWA. So here it is. Thanks, ChatGPT! :)
